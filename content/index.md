**Decentralized Technology is a non-profit, free, open source and peer reviewed journal for contributions in blockchain technology and the distributed ecosystem in general**. We aim to review and publish papers in the following topics, guaranteeing quick publication:
- Protocol design
- Consensus design
- Cyber-security
- Hardware design
- Algorithms/implementation
- Theoretical characterizations of concepts relevant to decentralization
- Economic, Legal, Political and Sociological modeling and design for decentralized ecosystems
- Impact of decentralization on Economics, Law, Society and Politics
- Philosophical considerations on decentralization

## Editorial policy

Our [editorial policy](editorial-policy.html) contains some revolutionary differences with respect to conventional ones, such as:
- Papers are published as soon as they are accepted: publication dates are not arranged in issues;
- Reviews rely on a first anonymous, then public process;
- Editors, reviews and reviewers names are made public at publication time, and integrated in the submission as appendixes;
- The journal is publication-format agnostic;
- Negative results are also welcome.

Nor authors or readers have to pay any fee to use the journal: **submission is free and publications are freely available**.

The editorial policy is still in a draft phase. If you have any suggestion please join the discussion!
