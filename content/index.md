# Journal Proposal: Decentral
> [name=Fabrizio Romano Genovese] The name is still to be decided, but "Decentral" is a nice suggestion!

## Motivation
The world of crypto is expanding, both technologically and economically. Nearly every aspect of society can be re-engineered and modelled in some crypto ecosystem, making the possibilities endless. 

As it often happens in such cases, tech and ideas are growing much faster than academia and established society structures can cope with. The result is that **many proposals are not sufficiently audited, or peer reviewed**. This is undesirable because many pieces of tech or ideas that are released in the crypto environment will likely be used to manage billions, and they are more often than not assumed to work "by trust". Here are a couple of examples which illustrate the point:

- A proposed consensus protocol that is not peer reviewed or audited may have both theoretical and implementation flaws, making it prone to bugs or security vulnerabilities. If said protocol is used to manage consensus on a blockchain it could cause massive losses for everyone involved and a severe blow to the image of the whole crypto community.
- Many crypto projects are not only tech-oriented, but also based on a precise social/political model. An example of this is the way in which communities such as DASH are managed. The idea here is that crypto doesn't just allow to engineer infrastructure, but also to shape society as a whole. Clearly, as in the previous point, if some political/sociological models are implemented naively, or if they are assumed to hold without sufficient justification, the end behaviour could be very different from the expected behaviour, possibly with disastrous consequences. For instance, one may create a cryptocurrency based on a community model to improve equality, then find that the chosen model is wrong and end up in a state of absolute monopoly.

In addition to this, it has to be noted how **the absence of any trusted party reviewing theoretical contributions to crypto has been replaced with a mechanism essentially based on appeal to authority**. It doesn't need stressing how detrimental this is. Essentially, there are very influential people in the cryptosphere who are assumed to be always right, tech-omniscient and infallible, and any form of endorsement on part of those people to a given project is considered by many a sound investment advice. However, such people are humans (as everyone else is), and hence they are necessarily fallible. For instance, a very influential person could just quickly skim through a proposal for a consensus algorithm and miss a critical flaw. Such a person could then speak fondly about it and endorse it, causing many people to push for its adoption. The amount of damage that this could cause, both to the cryptosystem as a whole and to the influencer themselves, is huge.

It is clear then that such authority-based mechanism should be replaced with something different, which is more compatible with the underlying principles of crypto: absence of authorities, scientific skepticism, rational mindset. 

## Scope

- The journal **will not** review whitepapers, to avoid any obvious conflicts of interest.
- The journal **will** review contributions in the following fields:
     - Protocol design
     - Consensus design
     - Cyber-security
     - Hardware design
     - Algorithms/implementation
     - Theoretical characterizations of concepts relevant to crypto
     - Economical models for crypto ecosystems
     - Political/sociological models for crypto ecosystems
     - Philosophical considerations for crypto ecosystems
     
    It is evident that the scope of the journal is very broad, and is essentially concerned with any kind of contribution, scientific or relating to the social sciences, that may extend and/or characterize the crypto ecosystem in any way. Since the scope is so broad, there have to be some caveats:
    - Papers that are not strictly crypto should be sent elsewhere, and editors should actively enforce this policy. For instance, a paper about cryptographic security should be accepted for review/publication only if it has a clear focus on application for blockchain technology.
    - Papers should be focused on theoretical/practical contributions and not on business. Excerpts from a whitepaper that are handwavy and without meaningful references should be rejected straight away.
    - For the same reason, the quality of submissions should be of academic standard. Submitting to our journal should be seen as an opportunity to specify concepts in great amount of detail (the kind of detail that one can't usually put into a work intended for a broader audience) to allow quality peer-review.

## Structure
The journal should have the following structure:
- A group of founders/creators, that oversee the project and materially run it. This includes taking care of ordinary administration, including funding and finance, and managing relations between the steering committee and editors.
  
     **The amount of time that founders have to put into the project is substantial.**
    
- A steering committee, that is responsible for the editorial direction and focus that the journal should have. People in the steering committee are assumed to be very well known in the crypto environment and to understand where the community is going and what its needs are. They should also have enough power to be influential and boost the journal's public image, which is fundamental to ensure broad adoption.

    **The amount of time that a member of the steering committee has to put into the project can go from 0** (essentially tweeting about it, more of a diplomatic role) **to quite substantial**.
    
- An editorial committee, consisting of experts in various fields that will take care of the scientific part. They communicate the status of a submission to its authors, take care of rebuttals, and locate the right people for the review process. Along with the creators, they have to ensure that the overall review process is fair and efficient.

    **The amount of time that editors have to put into the project is substantial.**
- Reviewers. These are people that are very skilled in a given field, and materially read a submission and evaluate it. Since the scope of the journal is broad, it is more than likely that from time to time editors will have to outsource reviewers to ensure fair judgement. If a reviewer has been chosen to review something on which he/she feels lacking proper skill, the reviewer should nevertheless be able to suggest someone else to consider for the review process.

    **The amount of time that reviewers have to put into the project depends on how much review work they want to do.**

## Proposed review process
Our proposal for the review process has several innovations wrt standard academic practices, and it is as follows:
- A paper is submitted. The editors committee sends a receipt notification to the (corresponding) author(s).
- The editors committee **strips the names from the paper to ensure that the review process is unbiased**. At this point, three reviewers are contacted for the review process. **No reviewer knows who the other reviewes are.** If some of the reviewers don't feel up to the task, they should say it as soon as possible and new reviewers will be selected.
- The paper is reviewed. This process should be quick, and not take more than 2 months.
- The editors take note of the review outcomes and decide if the paper is accepted or not. They communicate the decision to the authors, together with the reviews.
- The authors can accept the decision or, in case they feel the review process has not been fair, write a rebuttal.
- In case of rebuttal, the editors will evaluate the situation and decide if the review process has to be performed again.
- In case of acceptance, **the reviews and the names of the reviewers are made public and attached to the paper**. This is fundamental to ensure transparency for the whole process, and creates a system where **reviewers actively contribute to the paper**. This should push for better, more detailed peer reviewing process.

- The final paper is published, and the journal releases a DOI to be linked to it, proving that the peer-review process has happened. Any changes made by the authors between the submitted version and the final version are tracked, so that the reviews can be understood in the fullness of their original context.

The process workflow is shown in the following picture, where the tasks are sorted into four lanes representing, top to bottom: the authors, the editors, the reviewers and the things that can be automated.

## Openness

The operating scheme of the journal is fairly classical. Albeit many ideas for decentralized academia and publications in general have been proposed in the last years, we do not feel that at the moment they are developed enough to be adoptable on a large scale. In particular, decentralized approaches that are based on "network reputation" are often prone to the same appeal to authority bias that we mentioned before. This is because unqualified people are able to endorse someone that they deem qualified, even when this is not the case. The main focus of the journal is to have principled, theoretically-informed reviews: all reviewers should therefore have an established curriculum/expertise in the fields they are being asked to review.

Clearly, this may create other types of prejudices, and this is why we are opting for an open-reviews system, where the names of the reviewers are made public at the end of the process. In this case, the crypto community could give us feedback telling us if they agree or not with a particular review.

Moreover, listing the reviewer names on the paper is itself a form of contribution, that makes having to pay reviewers unnecessary.

Also, we want to be as open and as inclusive as possible, and we will do everything in our power to mantain contact with the community. We should invite everyone that wants to become an editor/reviewer, or to endorse an editor/reviewer, to write to us: all in all, the fact that our approach is (for the moment) centralized shouldn't deter us from being open to community suggestions, and from vetting those suggestions in detail.

## Further material

Aside from the main submission topics listed above, we also welcome a kind of submission called **negative results**.

In other academic fields, it is more often than not the case that negative results cannot be published, unless they are interesting by themselves. For instance, a failed experiment to sintesize a new molecule wouldn't normally be accepted for publication. This is bad, since building an archive of approaches that didn't work could save researches a lot of time. We want to solve this problem by accepting such negative results as a separate kind of contribution to the journal.

Note how such contributions will still have to be reviewed: it has to be made sure that the failure of a given approach didn't depend on author's misbehavior (e.g. an experiment failing because its setup wasn't prepared well), so that others are not unduly deterret to pursue approaches that might yield fruit with more sophisticated efforts.
